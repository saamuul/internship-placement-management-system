## 💾 Data Management

The system uses CSV files for data persistence, located in the `data/` directory:

- **`sample_student_list.csv`**: Student account information
- **`sample_company_representative_list.csv`**: Company representative accounts
- **`sample_staff_list.csv`**: Career staff accounts

The `CSVLoader` utility class handles loading and parsing of these data files.
